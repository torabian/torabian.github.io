      "A deep dive into creating high-performance, scalable APIs using Go and modern development practices.",
    content: `# Building Scalable Go APIs

## Overview

In this experience, I'll share my journey of building high-performance APIs using Go, covering everything from basic HTTP handlers to advanced microservices architecture.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Go's Concurrency Model
Go's goroutines and channels make it incredibly easy to handle thousands of concurrent requests. The key is understanding how to properly manage goroutine pools and avoid goroutine leaks.

\`\`\`go
func handleRequests(requests <-chan Request) {
    for req := range requests {
        go func(r Request) {
            processRequest(r)
        }(req)
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Database Optimization
- Connection pooling is crucial for performance
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Consider read replicas for heavy read workloads

### 3. Caching Strategies
- Redis for session storage and frequently accessed data
- HTTP caching headers for static content
- Application-level caching for expensive computations

### 4. Monitoring and Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Distributed tracing for microservices
- Health checks and graceful shutdowns

## Architecture Decisions

The API follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Handlers**: HTTP request/response handling
- **Services**: Business logic implementation
- **Repositories**: Data access layer
- **Models**: Domain entities and DTOs

## Performance Results

- **Throughput**: 50,000+ requests per second
- **Latency**: P99 under 10ms
- **Memory Usage**: Stable at 100MB under load
- **CPU Usage**: Efficient utilization with goroutines

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a monolithic approach, then extract services as needed
2. **Measure Everything**: You can't optimize what you don't measure
3. **Fail Fast**: Implement proper error handling and circuit breakers
4. **Document APIs**: Use OpenAPI/Swagger for better developer experience

## Next Steps

- Implement GraphQL for more flexible data fetching
- Add gRPC for internal service communication
- Explore service mesh with Istio
- Implement advanced caching with CDN integration

This experience taught me that Go's simplicity and performance make it an excellent choice for building scalable APIs. The key is to leverage its strengths while following best practices for maintainability and reliability.`,

## Key Technologies Used

- **React Native 0.72+**
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Navigation** for navigation
- **React Query** for data fetching
- **Flipper** for debugging

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Platform Differences
**Problem**: iOS and Android handle certain features differently.
**Solution**: Created platform-specific implementations with shared business logic.

### Challenge 2: Performance Issues
**Problem**: App was slow on older devices.
**Solution**: Implemented lazy loading, image optimization, and reduced bundle size.

### Challenge 3: State Management Complexity
**Problem**: Complex state management across multiple screens.
**Solution**: Implemented Redux Toolkit with proper data normalization.

## Results

- **Development Time**: 40% faster than native development

- **User Satisfaction**: 4.8/5 rating on app stores

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with Expo**: For rapid prototyping and development
2. **Use TypeScript**: Essential for large-scale applications
3. **Test on Real Devices**: Emulators don't catch all issues
4. **Plan for Platform Differences**: Design with both platforms in mind
5. **Optimize Early**: Performance issues are harder to fix later

## Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write comprehensive tests
- Follow platform-specific guidelines
