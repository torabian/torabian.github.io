# Amazing time picker

Amazing timepicker, is a unique experience in my career, which was written by me, and a friend as an open-source,
project. At the time, material design did not provide a time picker, a component for users to choose time,
and datetime field type from html was in early stages.

Hence we decided to write such component, and make it publicly available. Initial intention was to create it,
for a time heavy software, which user had to enter so many schedules.

Project was a great experience, in terms that at the time, I was early stages of my work in large consulting
company in Asia, and seeing that open source project is being adopted by many projects gave an extream passion and boost.

So the module itself, is giving a simple premise, a time picker. We gave the developer to install it via npm,
created cypress test engines for Angular 2, 4, 5, and I belive last at 7. Soon people started opening issues,
pull request, and then we added more and more to it. Customizing colors, language text, hour, minute selection.

Last publish of the npm was on 2018, it's really interesting to see how after 7 years still the product is being downloaded,
although significantlly declining due to fact we never updated it for next versions of Angular.

The IP of the work belongs to me, and Yousef Sami - you can take a look at the history, if you are interested.
