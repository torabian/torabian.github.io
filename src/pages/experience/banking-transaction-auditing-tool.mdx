# Banking transaction auditing tool.

I have created a front-end part of a banking tool, for one of the largest investment banks in Europe. A outsourcing company 
approached me, to create a special tool for auditing currency exchange operations. In first glance,
it sounded quite easy, to show a list of transactions, maybe few columns of data, and a pagination at most. 

Moving forward, I have realised how much details we had to implement such software. 

- Users had to be able to select columns they want; they can be nested objects coming in.
- Locking and unlocking columns both at the end and start, since they were so many columns and horizontal scrolling
would of happened regardless.
- Searching, filtering, in a very advanced mode.
- Sorting with custom logics coming from backend; allowing sort, cascading sort, changes in the logic when a special
combination of sort is happening.
- Multiple editing, inline editing and also opening a modal for selected item(s), and handling errors across them.
- Saving a view, creating snapshot, exporting a result into csv and pdf.
- Drag and dropping columns to reorder
- Expanding each row, to see extra details, features, and keepign them visually aligned with parent row

The list of features are so long, and it got me suprising how much details are involved in such tool. Often in
most projects, we make a simple table for showing information, but banking environment is very different. Such table,
is often what major workers in bank use for 90% of time, so even small glitches and hardship using them would
quickly become annoying and unproductive.

For anyone likes to understand a bit more about the possiblities, they can take a look the underlying module which I have used,
and in mid time of project I had to modify a lot of features in the source to make it work with my client requirements.

I loved the library though, it had a lot of things though through in it, which wouldn't come to my mind or hard to implement,
all from scratch.
