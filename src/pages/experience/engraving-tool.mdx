# Engraving tool

I have been hired to create an engraving tool from scratch (kinda migrating existing one from jquery to react)
for a major jewerly brand. They sell jewerly world wide, and one of their services is engraving.

The action is simple - you choose a neckless, or a bracelet, then you can engrave a shape, text,
or combination of them together. Definitely sounds easy at first, but the amount of details were really interesting.

One of the challenges was to detect, if a text is protruding from an engravable area, which I had to write
advanced canvas api to calculate a fast, and quick implementation for it. Later one, 
the custom file format, which was compatible with their backend, and SISMA engraving machine was also
a requirement to be considered in the product.

Loading custom fonts, mixing the images to become fonts, saving state, enabling undo, an all these
minor things really become challenge in the project. 

I was very happy to see on Warsaw centrum, the project was advertised. It's so cool to feel the work
you have been done is being used by people around you.
