# Heatpump and gas boiler controller application

Working for a German client, I've participated in development of their application, which would
control the heat pumps and gas boilers which was manufactured by company.

The company was a large scale, top efficiency heating products manufacturer, mostly focused
on gas boilers and heat pumps, and in order to give the end customers option to control heating
via app, they provided such software.

Application was consisted of 2 major different aspects:

- Installator app, which would help servicing and first-time commisioners, to search for fault codes,
first time process, checking the data point values. This was available as web and mobile app,
as well as a portable version of it on a tablet to connect directly via EBUS controllers
for live monitoring.

- End user app, which would house tenants or owners use, to set temperature of the rooms,
turn on, off, setup a weekly plan, check berif status of the system, set alarms 
and other details which you might think needed for that.

Appliances very kinda unique in market. For example, 
their API Developer program, and heatpump internal controller circuit, could possibly offer
major customization, for running external pumps, cascading.

I have been participating on the products for a long period of time, and many features were integrated by me.
