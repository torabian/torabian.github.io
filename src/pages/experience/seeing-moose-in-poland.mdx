# Seeing moose in Poland

Living near to nature has it's own suprises for me still. Recently there was a snow in Poland, and I was driving in the dark and saw
moose near the driveway. Moose are fun to see, but often they are a security issue while driving. They might react late,
or just jump in to the way, and depends how fast you going, you are going to loose bumper or even radiator in your car.
