# Telephony app

One of my great experience in terms of mobile application, was a telephony app which would allow users
to create teams which would take calls in need of emergency.

The usecase of the software is in medical and take caring services mostly, when a phone number is given
for people who need immediate care, and their call is being forwarded between nursing people available on
the phone number.

The application, consists of few features:

- Creating a virtual phone book for the team,
- Precise calender planning, in order to make sure all 24 hours is covered at least by someone
- Call forwarding, if a single agent is not able to answer;
- Sending email to extra services in case a phone call has been initiated.

The end user, is only having a phone number to call, and the application is being used by the answering team,
and used for planning.

One of the challenges in developing such app is, to make sure modifying times, do not overlap, and overlapped 
availability, would be splited. It was a bit challenging since the software backend was started already in
firebase serverless services, and at the time there was no data base locking or concurrent request access
management to implement this. Hence, needed a lot of extra checks on client side.

From technical perspective, it was written on React Native, and made available for IOS and Android, in fact mostly
using manually artifacts creation, signing and upload to perspective stores.
