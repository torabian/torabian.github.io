# Golang

Golang is one of my major skills in terms of programming languages I do work with'em. With many years
of experience so far, working on different projects such a cli tools, frameworks, shopping services,
database and system services software, I have grasped a major experience in the language and ecosystem
around it so far.

In fact, Golang in my opinion is way to go language for creating anything, which is possible. Go compiles,
fast, and without a dependency to run. This is amazing feature, small binaries, reliable, written in 
a realtively easy language.

Go is really portable. In fact, is the most portable language ever. Sometimes people think C/C++ is most
portable, but reality is Go is a such language compiles, and runs as a ecosystem.

Go execution speed, makes it perfect for cli tools, algorithms, and speed sensitive tasks which
most tools are incapable of. Built in database support, auto formatting code feature is reducing
debates and developer opinion regarding doing things.

You might want to check my major multi year framework on golang,

in this framework, you can build blazingly fast, backend projects, which include major feature from 
first day.
