title: ATS-01 Standard for React Native List based projects
author: Ali Torabi
excerpt: Set of rules to follow and check against for high quality, low maintenance react native lists screens. By implementing these rules, you make sure every screen in your app has a good UI experience for the user.

ATS-01 is a set of rules, which will be granted into any list, if it meets certain level of the conditions.
Lack of quality in many products which we see, is due to missing full implementation of these rules.
*You might already have this rules available in your app* - therefor no need to make adjustments just to use this document
as reference.

**Technologies**: React Native

**Programming Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript


## Why the lists are important?

Mobile applications are built heavily around lists. In a mobile device, user is usually swiping vertically and less often horizontally.
Thus, software companies need to focus on building better lists which interacts more smoothly.

## Conditions to meet ATS-01

Here is the interactive list of ATS-01 standard. ATS-01 is met when the screen must implement or be implemeneted:

* Only in React Native framework
* By FlatList or other virtual list
* Error handling for first-fetch strategy
* Error handling when a set of data is present to the user
* Empty list strategy
* Pagination
* Skeleton loader
* Taking too long indication
* Timeout and retry mechanism
* Request cancellation on leaving the screen


### Only in React Native framework

The application needs to be written in React Native. Android/IOS/Ionic/Xamarin and etc are not accpted in this standard.

### By FlatList or other virtual list

Starndard only applies to screens which need to show dataset, usually from remote service or bluetooth, WIFI devices.
It does not apply to stationary elements, which are put in **ScrollView**

Examples:

- List of posts
- List of images
- Bluetooth devices around

### Error handling for first-fetch strategy

Screen needs to have a clear strategy, to show the errors occured while fetching information from remote, or any other
permission issues, requirement in the first list.

### Error handling when a set of data is present to the user

Screen should handle in case of subsequent failures of fetching data, or changes to parameters, and show them on top of the list,
as header and give user clear action point to move next steps.


### Empty list strategy

Screen needs to clearly give user feedback if the remote list is empty.
**It should be different than network failures, other impediments precluding user to understand real data availabilty.**


### Pagination

The screen should load the data from it's remote based on user scroll threshold. Even if the remote source does not have such possiblity,
you need to make a `PaginatableArray` out of it pass it to this component.

### Skeleton loader

On the first pull, you need to have skeleton porportional to the real items implemented. User should not see a loader,
while the screen is opened first time.

### Taking too long indication

In case loading of data is taking longer than usual, there should be indication of that, tell the user that they can
cancel or retry in specific amount of time.

### Timeout and retry mechanism

It should be giving user message "Pull to retry" in case of failure in first or subsequent requests.

### Request cancellation on leaving the screen

Screen needs to keep an strategy to clean up remote requests, BLE scanning, or any ongoing process to provide data
in to screen, in case user tried to leave the screen.
